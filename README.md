# FizzBuzz
 
For the FizzBuzz problem I have thought about two different solutions:

1> standard method

2> using linq 

Following SOLID principles, for logging added an interface, IConsoleWriter and 
as implementations ConsoleLog and MockConsoleLog.

On execution the results are logged in the Results folder.

Added a test project with various tests to cover many scenarios.
